####Briefly explain the need for the app (the "what").

Speaky Jumbo is a language exchange app that let you interact with native speakers of the language that you're learning. . Tufts student can find their own language partner according to their native language and the language they want to learn or practice. They can do the same to help their partner out as well.

###List and briefly describe the core functionality of the app, the most important functions and transactions of the app.

This app's core functionality is finding some language partners between those international students who have just come to Tufts and some tufts native speakers  who wants to learn a foreign language. Those students who have such needs can have a good channel to improve their language skills. 

###List and briefly describe the secondary functionality of the app, the functions and transactions of the app that are nice to have only if time allows.

Students can meet new friends and learn other culture at the same time.
	
####List the features on a mobile device that the app will use (e.g., camera, GPS, SMS, flashlight).

So far we don't think we'll need any Android uses-permission on this app.
	
####Briefly describe any limitations each team member may feel that will hold back progress.


* Yedi Wang: I think the hardest thing is that let this app connect to the network, and store the data on the server. Also, I'm totally new to Java language. Learning these new things in such a short time is a challenge to me.

* Tong Dong: I am not a CS student, so maybe using java to make a Android studio app is a big challenge to me.
